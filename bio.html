	<h1> Biography </h1>
	<p> I am a sophomore at Tufts University, majoring in Computer Science. I love Ballroom dancing. Come watch me compete with the Tufts Ballroom Team! I also sail with the Tufts Sailing Team. Click <a href= "http://scores.collegesailing.org/sailors/ashley-smith/"> here </a> to check out my regatta results! I love spending time at Hillel and you can almost always find me there on a Friday night at Tufts. The rest of my free time is spent in Halligan, home of the Computer Science department, collaborating with others to code awesome new things! </p>
